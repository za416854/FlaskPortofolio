Specifically, I have learned to use CSS and HTML to create visually appealing and responsive web pages, as well as JavaScript and Vue.js for client-side scripting. On the back-end, I have worked with C#, .NET framework, .NET webform, .NET core MVC, and ADO.NET for server-side scripting, data access, and creating dynamic web applications.\nDuring the course, I have completed three web development projects using different technologies: a shopping website using .NET webform, an employee attendance management system using .NET webform, and a travel guide website using .NET core MVC. These projects have allowed me to apply my knowledge and gain hands-on experience in web development.\nOverall, I am excited to continue learning and growing as a programmer, and I am eager to contribute my skills to a dynamic and challenging team.', os.path.join('forum','static', 'img', 'bootscamp.jpg'), connection)
